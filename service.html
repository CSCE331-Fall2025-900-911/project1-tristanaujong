        <p>
            I have done many community service projects, each one accomplishing a different need. 
            It's very fulfilling to help people out when they need it, and I enjoy every project I 
            volunteer in. Being able to connect with the local community is nice, and while it is 
            easy to focus only on ourselves at times, it is very refreshing to give a hand to those
            around you.
        </p>
        <p>
            My most recent act of community service was with TAO, where we participated in
            TAMU's The Big Event, where we are assigned a local residents house and help them out with
            things like yard work, house cleaning, and more. Our resident, Donna, was an elderly woman
            who couldn't lift up the heavy tree branches or rake the thousands of leaves piled up in her
            yard by herself, so by being able to help her with these tasks, it left a positive impact on
            everyone involved. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For Interact Club, I was the club's president during my senior year of high
            school, and I got to help out with fundraisers that raised money towards the Ukraine War. Our
            collective area raised a total of $3,436, which went towards funding Mobile Medical Units to
            be deployed in active war zones in Ukraine. This was a very fun effort to help towards and
            I'm so happy we were able to raise so much money for this cause. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the Encouragement Quintet,
            we went to families who were dealing with hardships at the time, so me and 4 other orchestra
            members went around and uplifted the spirits of these families with our music. It was very
            touching to see all these people appreciate our music in the moment, and everyone we visited
            was grateful for our time and company.
