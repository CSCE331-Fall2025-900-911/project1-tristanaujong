        <h2><a href="https://boostboardsco.com/">BoostBoards</a></h2>
        <p>
            Shopify website for my small business BoostBoards. I added custom functionality
            to allow for file uploads and custom fields for customers to add information
            for their orders. By implementing these features myself, I was able to
            completely eliminate third-party app costs and save 33% on my monthly bill as a 
            result.

            TAMUHack 2025 Project. Collaborated in a team of 4 to accomplish a problem
            statement given by Toyota: "Create a solution that allows a customer to shop 
            for a Toyota with ease." We developed a product matching application that allowed
            a customer to find a compatible Toyota within seconds.

        <p>
            Website for ENGR TAO. Before this, we relied on Discord only, but with our
            membership surpassing the 5,000 mark, we transferred to a website to better
            accommodate the large number of members. Worked alongside 9 team members and 
            deployed the website in time for the Fall 2024 semester.
