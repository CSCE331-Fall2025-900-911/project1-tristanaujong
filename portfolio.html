            <p>
                Shopify website for my small business BoostBoards. I added custom functionality
                to allow for file uploads and custom fields for customers to add information
                for their orders. By implementing these features myself, I was able to
                completely eliminate third-party app costs and save 33% on my monthly bill as a 
                result.

                TAMUHack 2025 Project. Collaborated in a team of 4 to accomplish a problem
                statement given by Toyota: "Create a solution that allows a customer to shop 
                for a Toyota with ease." We developed a product matching application that allowed
                a customer to find a compatible Toyota within seconds.

                Website for ENGR TAO. Before this, we relied on Discord only, but with our
                membership surpassing the 5,000 mark, we transferred to a website to better
                accomodate the large amount of members. Worked alongside 9 team members and 
                deployed the website in time for the Fall 2024 semester.
